                I have experience in creating dynamic and responsive websites using React.js, Javascript,
                and tailwind CSS. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to solve
                real-world problems. Some of the projects I have worked on include a restaurant
                website, note taking app, and my export business website. You can check out my portfolio
                and contact me below. Thank you for visiting my website!</p>
